## ChAImeleon Contribution

The repository contains the source code for ChaAImeleon challenge for the following subtasks:
- Prostate
- Lung
- Rectum

The same algorithms was applied to all the tasks - Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) combined with the open-source pretrained EfficientNet from Torchvision library.

Note: The final submission to the Rectum subtask had a bug which is corrected in this repository. Therefore, the results may substantially change.
